            We started Wanderly Tours with one simple belief: that the most
            meaningful travel experiences don’t happen in a rush. They happen
            when you take your time — to look, to listen, and to connect with
            the place beneath your feet.
          </p>

            Wanderly was born out of long hikes in the Highlands, shared
            laughter around coastal campfires, and conversations with locals who
            changed the way we saw the world. What began as a few guided walks
            for friends and friends-of-friends has grown into something much
            bigger: a small, dedicated team of guides and travelers who believe
            in exploring Britain in a slower, deeper way.
